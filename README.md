## Experience Using the Archival tools:
## WebRecorderIO:
 
* Got hanged when trying with this url: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9985109/Mumbai-terror-attacks-the-making-of-a-monster.html

* There is a Video embeded in the following http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2008/11/26/VI2008112603904.html which could be played with the normal browser with the flash player enabled, but this video couldn’t be captured via WebRecorderIO.

* If there are multiple inner links to be archived, WebRecorderIO  needs us to navigate to each of those links.

* Best thing is the one can capture the sublinks only when needed with in a document.


## Archive-IT
* Best thing is that all the seeds can be specified at once and can choose any of the available options.

* Groupname when added isn’t showing for the first refresh.

* Grammarly had got something to do with adding seeds.


##  With WarCreate
* Nice chrome extension to create a warc file of the current viewing web page, it’s kinda pain to create the warc file of the embedded link and relate these with the seed, takes lot of manual work.

* Of Course takes more time for the larger files and downloading the WARC isn’t promising.


##  With WAIL
* I personally liked this application the most to have a Archive Collection locally, this tool is the best. 

* The check seed functionality is really great, which give the number of same domain and external seeds.

* If there is a kind of intermediate progress show on each memento would had been great.

* I realise the process is stuck, or maybe not showing any progress , except there is an icon showing the crawl is running.


### Are these Seeds enough ? And how can someone use this collection.
With the Archiving been done on these seeds, I can see that this data is preserved for ever until Archive-It and webrecorder decides to shutdown, 
And thanks to WSDL Group that i do have the local copies beacuse of WAIL and Warcreate. I can say that these 15 seeds covered almost every insight about the terrible incident that happened.
